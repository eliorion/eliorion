# 👋 Hi, I'm Eliorion

I’m a software engineer moving with intention toward DevOps, Cloud Engineering, and DevSecOps. My background in embedded systems taught me precision, reliability, and a strong understanding of how complex architectures behave under constraints. Over time, this foundation naturally led me toward infrastructure, automation, and the design of secure, maintainable, and scalable environments.



## 🌐 What I’m Building
Right now, my main focus is a complete homelab that mirrors real production practices. I designed it as a space where I can architect and operate a full DevSecGitOps stack from the ground up.  
Inside this lab, everything revolves around a simple idea: infrastructure should be defined, versioned, automated, observable, and secure by default.

I work with Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code, GitOps workflows, CI/CD pipelines, service networking, cluster security, and continuous monitoring. This ecosystem is my way of learning not just how tools work, but why they matter, how they interact, and how they shape modern cloud-native platforms.


## 🔧 How I Think About Engineering
I value systems that are predictable, elegant, and stable.  
For me, DevOps is not a tooling trend but a culture built around clarity, trust, repeatability, and meaningful automation.  
Cloud engineering is about designing platforms that empower development rather than slowing it down.  
DevSecOps is about embedding security so deeply that it becomes a natural part of the workflow rather than a late obstacle.

My work is driven by curiosity and by the desire to understand how infrastructure behaves when it scales, how failures propagate, and how architecture decisions can prevent them long before they appear.



## 🎓 My Technical Journey
I come from the world of real-time embedded software engineering, where every detail matters and correctness is non-negotiable.  
Alongside this technical foundation, I am completing a master’s degree in Engineering Management, which strengthens my ability to think beyond implementation and consider strategy, process design, and long-term platform vision.

This combination helps me bridge the gap between deep technical work and high-level system thinking, an essential skill in DevOps and cloud platform engineering.



## 🚀 What Drives Me
I enjoy building environments that make development teams faster, safer, and more confident.  
I enjoy understanding problems at their roots and designing solutions that are both simple and resilient.  
I enjoy working at the intersection where code, infrastructure, security, and architecture meet.

I’m here to learn, to build, and to contribute to systems that matter.

If any of this resonates, feel free to explore my repositories or reach out. My GitHub is the place where my ideas take shape and where my homelab evolves day after day.
